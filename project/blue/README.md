Introduction
Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and features for creating web applications in the Python Language. SQLAlchemy is an SQL toolkit that provides efficient and high-performing database access for relational databases. It provides ways to interact with several database engines such as SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. It gives you access to the database’s SQL functionalities. And it also gives you an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), which allows you to make queries and handle data using simple Python objects and methods. Flask-SQLAlchemy is a Flask extension that makes using SQLAlchemy with Flask easier, providing you tools and methods to interact with your database in your Flask applications through SQLAlchemy.

A one-to-many database relationship is a relationship between two database tables where a record in one table can reference several records in another table. For example, in a blogging application, a table for storing posts can have a one-to-many relationship with a table for storing comments. Each post can reference many comments, and each comment references a single post; therefore, one post has a relationship with many comments. The post table is a parent table, while the comments table is a child table — a record in the parent table can reference many records in the child table. This relationship is important to enable access to related data in each table.

In this tutorial, you’ll build a small blogging system that demonstrates how to build one-to-many relationships using the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension. You’ll create a relationship between posts and comments, where each blog post can have several comments.

Prerequisites
A local Python 3 programming environment. Follow the tutorial for your distribution in How To Install and Set Up a Local Programming Environment for Python 3 series. In this tutorial we’ll call our project directory flask_app.

An understanding of basic Flask concepts, such as routes, view functions, and templates. If you are not familiar with Flask, check out How to Create Your First Web Application Using Flask and Python and How to Use Templates in a Flask Application.

An understanding of basic HTML concepts. You can review our How To Build a Website with HTML tutorial series for background knowledge.

Step 1 — Installing Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy
In this step, you’ll install the necessary packages for your application.

With your virtual environment activated, use pip to install Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy:

pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy
Once the installation is successfully finished, you’ll see a line similar to the following at the end of the output:

Output
Successfully installed Flask-2.1.1 Flask-SQLAlchemy-2.5.1 Jinja2-3.1.1 MarkupSafe-2.1.1 SQLAlchemy-1.4.35 Werkzeug-2.1.1 click-8.1.2 greenlet-1.1.2 itsdangerous-2.1.2
With the required Python packages installed, you’ll set up the database next.

Step 2 — Setting up the Database and Models
In this step, you’ll set up your database, and create SQLAlchemy database models — Python classes that represent your database tables. You’ll create a model for your blog posts and a model for comments. You’ll initiate the database, create a table for posts, and add a table for comments based on the models you’ll declare. You’ll also insert a few posts and comments into your database.

Setting up The Database Connection
Open a file called app.py in your flask_app directory. This file will have code for setting up the database and your Flask routes:

nano app.py
This file will connect to an SQLite database called database.db, and will have two classes: A class called Post that represents your database posts table, and a Comment class representing the comments table. This file will also contain your Flask routes. Add the following import statements at the top of app.py:

flask_app/app.py
import os
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

Here, you import the os module, which gives you access to miscellaneous operating system interfaces. You’ll use it to construct a file path for your database.db database file.

From the flask package, you then import the necessary helpers you need for your application: the Flask class to create a Flask application instance, the render_template() function to render templates, the request object to handle requests, the url_for() function to construct URLs for routes, and the redirect() function for redirecting users. For more information on routes and templates, see How To Use Templates in a Flask Application.

You then import the SQLAlchemy class from the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension, which gives you access to all the functions and classes from SQLAlchemy, in addition to helpers, and functionality that integrates Flask with SQLAlchemy. You’ll use it to create a database object that connects to your Flask application, allowing you to create and manipulate tables using Python classes, objects, and functions without needing to use the SQL language.

Below the imports, you’ll set up a database file path, instantiate your Flask application, and configure and connect your application with SQLAlchemy. Add the following code:

flask_app/app.py

basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] =\
           'sqlite:///' + os.path.join(basedir, 'database.db')
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False


db = SQLAlchemy(app)
Here, you construct a path for your SQLite database file. You first define a base directory as the current directory. You use the os.path.abspath() function to get the absolute path of the current file’s directory. The special __file__ variable holds the pathname of the current app.py file. You store the absolute path of the base directory in a variable called basedir.

You then create a Flask application instance called app, which you use to configure two Flask-SQLAlchemy configuration keys:

SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI: The database URI to specify the database you want to establish a connection with. In this case, the URI follows the format sqlite:///path/to/database.db. You use the os.path.join() function to intelligently join the base directory you constructed and stored in the basedir variable, and the database.db file name. This will connect to a database.db database file in your flask_app directory. The file will be created once you initiate the database.

SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS: A configuration to enable or disable tracking modifications of objects. You set it to False to disable tracking and use less memory. For more, see the configuration page in the Flask-SQLAlchemy documentation.

Note: If you want to use another database engine such as PostgreSQL or MySQL, you’ll need to use the proper URI.

For PostgreSQL, use the following format:

postgresql://username:password@host:port/database_name
For MySQL:

mysql://username:password@host:port/database_name
For more, see the SQLAlchemy documentation for engine configuration.

After configuring SQLAlchemy by setting a database URI and disabling tracking, you create a database object using the SQLAlchemy class, passing the application instance to connect your Flask application with SQLAlchemy. You store your database object in a variable called db. You’ll use this db object to interact with your database.

Declaring The Tables
With the database connection established and the database object created, you’ll use the database object to create a database table for posts and one for comments. Tables are represented by a model — a Python class that inherits from a base class Flask-SQLAlchemy provides through the db database instance you created earlier. To define the posts and comments tables as models, add the following two classes to your app.py file:

flask_app/app.py

class Post(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(100))
    content = db.Column(db.Text)
    comments = db.relationship('Comment', backref='post')

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<Post "{self.title}">'


class Comment(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    content = db.Column(db.Text)
    post_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('post.id'))

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<Comment "{self.content[:20]}...">'
Here, you create a Post model and a Comment model, which inherit from the db.Model class.

The Post model represents the post table. You use the db.Column class to define its columns. The first argument represents the column type, and additional arguments represent the column configuration.

You define the following columns for the Post model:

id: The post ID. You define it as an integer with db.Integer. primary_key=True defines this column as a primary key, which will assign it a unique value by the database for each entry (that is, each post).
title: The post’s title. A string with a maximum length of 100 characters.
content: The post’s content. db.Text indicates the column holds long texts.
The comments class attribute defines a One-to-Many relationship between the Post model and the Comment model. You use the db.relationship() method, passing it the name of the comments model (Comment in this case). You use the backref parameter to add a back reference that behaves like a column to the Comment model. This way, you can access the post the comment was posted on using a post attribute. For example, if you have a comment object in a variable called comment, you will be able to access the post the comment belongs to using comment.post. You’ll see an example demonstrating this later.

See the SQLAlchemy documentation for column types other than the types you used in the preceding code block.

The special __repr__ function allows you to give each object a string representation to recognize it for debugging purposes.

The Comment model represents the comment table. You define the following columns for it:

id: The comment ID. You define it as an integer with db.Integer. primary_key=True defines this column as a primary key, which will assign it a unique value by the database for each entry (that is, each comment).
content: The comment’s content. db.Text indicates the column holds long texts.
post_id: An integer foreign key you construct using the db.ForeignKey() class, which is a key that links a table with another, using that table’s primary key. This links a comment to a post using the primary key of the post, which is its ID. Here, the post table is a parent table, which indicates that each post has many comments. The comment table is a child table. Each comment is related to a parent post using the post’s ID. Therefore, each comment has a post_id column that can be used to access the post the comment was posted on.
The special __repr__ function in the Comment model shows the first 20 characters of the comment’s content to give a comment object a short string representation.

The app.py file will now look as follows:

flask_app/app.py
import os
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] =\
           'sqlite:///' + os.path.join(basedir, 'database.db')
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False


db = SQLAlchemy(app)


class Post(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(100))
    content = db.Column(db.Text)
    comments = db.relationship('Comment', backref='post')

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<Post "{self.title}">'


class Comment(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    content = db.Column(db.Text)
    post_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('post.id'))

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<Comment "{self.content[:20]}...">'
Save and close app.py.

Creating the Database
Now that you’ve set the database connection and the post and comment models, you’ll use the Flask shell to create your database and your post and comment tables based on the models you declared.

With your virtual environment activated, set the app.py file as your Flask application using the FLASK_APP environment variable:

export FLASK_APP=app
Then open the Flask shell using the following command in your flask_app directory:

flask shell
A Python interactive shell will be opened. This special shell runs commands in the context of your Flask application, so that the Flask-SQLAlchemy functions you’ll call are connected to your application.

Import the database object and the post and comment models, and then run the db.create_all() function to create the tables that are associated with your models:

from app import db, Post, Comment
db.create_all()
Leave the shell running, open another terminal window and navigate to your flask_app directory. You will now see a new file called database.db in flask_app.

Note: The db.create_all() function does not recreate or update a table if it already exists. For example, if you modify your model by adding a new column, and run the db.create_all() function, the change you make to the model will not be applied to the table if the table already exists in the database. The solution is to delete all existing database tables with the db.drop_all() function and then recreate them with the db.create_all() function like so:

db.drop_all()
db.create_all()
This will apply the modifications you make to your models, but will also delete all the existing data in the database. To update the database structure and preserve existing data, you’ll need to use schema migration, which allows you to modify your tables and preserve data. You can use the Flask-Migrate extension to perform SQLAlchemy schema migrations through the Flask command-line interface.

If you receive an error, make sure your database URI and your model declaration are correct.

Populating the Tables
After creating the database and the post and comment tables, you’ll create a file in your flask_app directory to add some posts and comments to your database.

Open a new file called init_db.py:

nano init_db.py
Add the following code to it. This file will create three post objects and four comment objects, and add them to the database:

flask_app/init_db.py
from app import db, Post, Comment

post1 = Post(title='Post The First', content='Content for the first post')
post2 = Post(title='Post The Second', content='Content for the Second post')
post3 = Post(title='Post The Third', content='Content for the third post')

comment1 = Comment(content='Comment for the first post', post=post1)
comment2 = Comment(content='Comment for the second post', post=post2)
comment3 = Comment(content='Another comment for the second post', post_id=2)
comment4 = Comment(content='Another comment for the first post', post_id=1)


db.session.add_all([post1, post2, post3])
db.session.add_all([comment1, comment2, comment3, comment4])

db.session.commit()
Save and close the file.

Here, you import the database object, the Post model, and the Comment model from the app.py file.

You create a few post objects using the Post model, passing the post’s title to the title parameter and the post’s content to the content parameter.

You then create a few comment objects, passing the comment’s content. You have two methods you can use to associate a comment with the post it belongs to. You can pass the post object to the post parameter as demonstrated in the comment1 and comment2 objects. And you can also pass the post ID to the post_id parameter, as demonstrated in the comment3 and comment4 objects. So you can just pass the integer ID of the post if you don’t have the post object in your code.

After defining the post and comment objects, you use the db.session.add_all() to add all post and comment objects to the database session, which manages transactions. Then you use the db.session.commit() method to commit the transaction and apply the changes to the database. For more on SQLAlchemy database sessions, see step 2 of the How to Use Flask-SQLAlchemy to Interact with Databases in a Flask Application tutorial.

Run the init_db.py file to execute the code and add the data to the database:

python init_db.py
To take a look at the data you added to your database, open the flask shell to query all posts and display their titles and the content of each post’s comments:

flask shell
Run the following code. This queries all posts and displays each post title and the comments of each post below it:

from app import Post

posts = Post.query.all()

for post in posts:
    print(f'## {post.title}')
    for comment in post.comments:
            print(f'> {comment.content}')
    print('----')
Here, you import the Post model from the app.py file. You query all the posts that exist in the database using the all() method on the query attribute, and save the result in a variable called posts. Then you use a for loop to go through each item in the posts variable. You print the title and then use another for loop to go through each comment belonging to the post. You access the post’s comments using post.comments. You print the comment’s content and then print the string '----' to separate between posts.

You’ll get the following output:

Output

## Post The First
> Comment for the first post
> Another comment for the first post
----
## Post The Second
> Comment for the second post
> Another comment for the second post
----
## Post The Third
----
As you can see, you can access the data of each post and the comments of each post with very little code.

Now exit the shell:

exit()
At this point, you have several posts and comments in your database. Next, you’ll create a Flask route for the index page and display all of the posts in your database on it.

Step 3 — Displaying All Posts
In this step, you’ll create a route and a template to display all the posts in the database on the index page.

Open your app.py file to add a route for the index page to it:

nano app.py
Add the following route at the end of the file:

flask_app/app.py

# ...

@app.route('/')
def index():
    posts = Post.query.all()
    return render_template('index.html', posts=posts)
Save and close the file.

Here, you create an index() view function using the app.route() decorator. In this function, you query the database and get all the posts like you did in the previous step. You store the query result in a variable called posts and then you pass it to a index.html template file you render using the render_template() helper function.

Before you create the index.html template file on which you’ll display the existing posts in the database, you’ll first create a base template, which will have all the basic HTML code other templates will also use to avoid code repetition. Then you’ll create the index.html template file you rendered in your index() function. To learn more about templates, see How to Use Templates in a Flask Application.

Create a templates directory, then open a new template called base.html:

mkdir templates
nano templates/base.html
Add the following code inside the base.html file:

flask_app/templates/base.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>{% block title %} {% endblock %} - FlaskApp</title>
    <style>
        .title {
            margin: 5px;
        }

        .content {
            margin: 5px;
            width: 100%;
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: row;
            flex-wrap: wrap;
        }

        .comment {
            padding: 10px;
            margin: 10px;
            background-color: #fff;
        }

        .post {
            flex: 20%;
            padding: 10px;
            margin: 5px;
            background-color: #f3f3f3;
            inline-size: 100%;
        }

        .title a {
            color: #00a36f;
            text-decoration: none;
        }

        nav a {
            color: #d64161;
            font-size: 3em;
            margin-left: 50px;
            text-decoration: none;
        }

    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <nav>
        <a href="{{ url_for('index') }}">FlaskApp</a>
        <a href="#">Comments</a>
        <a href="#">About</a>
    </nav>
    <hr>
    <div class="content">
        {% block content %} {% endblock %}
    </div>
</body>
</html>
Save and close the file.

This base template has all the HTML boilerplate you’ll need to reuse in your other templates. The title block will be replaced to set a title for each page, and the content block will be replaced with the content of each page. The navigation bar has three links: one for the index page, which links to the index() view function using the url_for() helper function, one for a Comments page, and one for an About page if you choose to add one to your application. You’ll edit this file later after you add a page for displaying all the latest comments to make the Comments link functional.

Next, open a new index.html template file. This is the template you referenced in the app.py file:

nano templates/index.html
Add the following code to it:

flask_app/templates/index.html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
    <span class="title"><h1>{% block title %} Posts {% endblock %}</h1></span>
    <div class="content">
        {% for post in posts %}
            <div class="post">
                <p><b>#{{ post.id }}</b></p>
                <b>
                    <p class="title">
                        <a href="#">
                            {{ post.title }}
                        </a>
                    </p>
                </b>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>{{ post.content }}</p>
                </div>
                <hr>
            </div>
        {% endfor %}
    </div>
{% endblock %}
Save and close the file.

Here, you extend the base template and replace the contents of the content block. You use an <h1> heading that also serves as a title. You use a Jinja for loop in the line {% for post in posts %} to go through each post in the posts variable that you passed from the index() view function to this template. You display the post ID, its title, and the post content. The post title will later link to a page that displays the individual post and its comments.

While in your flask_app directory with your virtual environment activated, tell Flask about the application (app.py in this case) using the FLASK_APP environment variable. Then set the FLASK_ENV environment variable to development to run the application in development mode and get access to the debugger. For more information about the Flask debugger, see How To Handle Errors in a Flask Application. Use the following commands to do this:

export FLASK_APP=app
export FLASK_ENV=development
Next, run the application:

flask run
With the development server running, visit the following URL using your browser:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/
You’ll see the posts you added to the database in a page similar to the following:

Index Page

You’ve displayed the posts you have in your database on the index page. Next, you’ll create a route for a post page, where you will display the details of each post and its comments below it.

Step 4 — Displaying a Single Post and its Comments
In this step, you’ll create a route and a template to display the details of each post on a dedicated page, and the post’s comments below it.

By the end of this step, the URL http://127.0.0.1:5000/1 will be a page that displays the first post (because it has the ID 1) and its comments. The URL http://127.0.0.1:5000/ID will display the post with the associated ID number, if it exists.

Leave the development server running and open a new terminal window.

Open app.py for modification:

nano app.py
Add the following route at the end of the file:

flask_app/app.py
# ...

@app.route('/<int:post_id>/')
def post(post_id):
    post = Post.query.get_or_404(post_id)
    return render_template('post.html', post=post)
Save and close the file.

Here, you use the route '/<int:post_id>/', with int: being a converter that converts the default string in the URL into an integer. post_id is the URL variable that will determine the post you’ll display on the page.

The ID is passed from the URL to the post() view function through the post_id parameter. Inside the function, you query the post table and retrieve a post by its ID using the get_or_404() method. This will save the post data in the post variable if it exists, and respond with a 404 Not Found HTTP error if no post with the given ID exists in the database.

You render a template called post.html and pass it the post you retrieved.

Open this new post.html template file:

nano templates/post.html
Type the following code in it. This will be similar to the index.html template, except that it will only display a single post:

flask_app/templates/post.html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
    <span class="title"><h1>{% block title %} {{ post.title }}  {% endblock %}</h1></span>
    <div class="content">
            <div class="post">
                <p><b>#{{ post.id }}</b></p>
                <b>
                    <p class="title">{{ post.title }}</p>
                </b>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>{{ post.content }}</p>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <h3>Comments</h3>
                {% for comment in post.comments %}
                    <div class="comment">
                        <p>#{{ comment.id }}</p>
                        <p>{{ comment.content }}</p>
                    </div>
                {% endfor %}
            </div>
    </div>
{% endblock %}
Save and close the file.

Here, you extend the base template, set the post title as a page title, display the post ID, post title, and the post content. Then, you go through the post comments available via post.comments. You display the comment ID, and the contents of the comment.

Use your browser to navigate to the URL for the second post:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/2/
You’ll see a page similar to the following:

Single Post Page

Next, edit index.html to make the title of the post link to the individual post:

nano templates/index.html
Edit the value of the href attribute of the post title’s link inside the for loop:

flask_app/templates/index.html

...

{% for post in posts %}
    <div class="post">
        <p><b>#{{ post.id }}</b></p>
        <b>
            <p class="title">
                <a href="{{ url_for('post', post_id=post.id)}}">
                {{ post.title }}
                </a>
            </p>
        </b>
        <div class="content">
            <p>{{ post.content }}</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
    </div>
{% endfor %}
Save and close the file.

Navigate to your index page or refresh it:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Click on each of the post titles on the index page. You’ll now see that each post links to the proper post page.

You’ve now created a page for displaying individual posts. Next, you’ll add a web form to the post page to allow users to add new comments.

Step 5 — Adding New Comments
In this step, you’ll edit the /<int:post_id>/ route and its post() view function, which handles displaying an individual post. You’ll add a web form below each post to allow users to add comments to that post, then you’ll handle the comment submission and add it to the database.

First, open the post.html template file to add a web form consisting of a text area for the comment’s content, and an Add Comment submit button.

nano templates/post.html
Edit the file by adding a form below the Comments H3 heading, and directly above the for loop:

flask_app/templates/post.html

<hr>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<form method="post">
    <p>
        <textarea name="content"
                    placeholder="Comment"
                    cols="60"
                    rows="5"></textarea>
    </p>

    <p>
        <button type="submit">Add comment</button>
    </p>
</form>
{% for comment in post.comments %}
Save and close the file.

Here, you add a <form> tag with the attribute method set to post to indicate that the form will submit a POST request.

You have a text area for the comment’s content, and a submit button.

With the development server running, use your browser to navigate to a post:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/2/
You’ll see a page similar to the following:

Single Post Page with Comment Form

This form sends a POST request to the post() view function, but because there is no code to handle the form submission, the form currently does not work.

Next, you will add code to the post() view function to handle the form submission and add the new comment to the database. Open app.py to handle the POST request the user submits:

nano app.py
Edit the /<int:post_id>/ route and its post() view function to look as follows:

flask_app/app.py

@app.route('/<int:post_id>/', methods=('GET', 'POST'))
def post(post_id):
    post = Post.query.get_or_404(post_id)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        comment = Comment(content=request.form['content'], post=post)
        db.session.add(comment)
        db.session.commit()
        return redirect(url_for('post', post_id=post.id))

    return render_template('post.html', post=post)
Save and close the file.

You allow both GET and POST requests using the methods parameter. GET requests are used to retrieve data from the server. POST requests are used to post data to a specific route. By default, only GET requests are allowed.

Inside the if request.method == 'POST' condition, you handle the POST request the user will submit via the form. You create a comment object using the Comment model, passing it the content of the submitted comment which you extract from the request.form object. You specify the post the comment belongs to using the post parameter, passing it the post object you retrieved using the post ID, with the get_or_404() method.

You add the comment object you constructed to the database session, commit the transaction, and redirect to the post page.

Now refresh the post page on your browser, write a comment, and submit it. You’ll see your new comment below the post.

You now have a web form that allows users to add comments to a post. For more on web forms, see How To Use Web Forms in a Flask Application. For a more advanced and more secure method of managing web forms, see How To Use and Validate Web Forms with Flask-WTF. Next, you’ll add a page that displays all the comments in the database and the posts they were posted on.

Step 6 — Displaying All Comments
In this step, you’ll add a Comments page where you will display all the comments in the database, ordering them by displaying the newest comments first. Each comment will have the title and link of the post the comment was posted on.

Open app.py:

nano app.py
Add the following route to the end of the file. This fetches all the comments in the database, ordered by the latest first. It then passes them to a template file called comments.html, which you’ll create later:

flask_app/app.py
# ...

@app.route('/comments/')
def comments():
    comments = Comment.query.order_by(Comment.id.desc()).all()
    return render_template('comments.html', comments=comments)
Save and close the file.

You use the order_by() method on the query attribute to fetch all the comments in a specific order. In this case you use the desc() method on the Comment.id column to fetch comments in descending order, with the latest comments being first. Then you use the all() method to get the result and save it to a variable called comments.

You render a template called comments.html, passing it the comments object which contains all comments ordered by the latest first.

Open this new comments.html template file:

nano templates/comments.html
Type the following code inside it. This will display the comments and link to the post they belong to:

flask_app/templates/comments.html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
    <span class="title"><h1>{% block title %} Latest Comments {% endblock %}</h1></span>
    <div class="content">
                {% for comment in comments %}
                    <div class="comment">
                        <i>
                            (#{{ comment.id }})
                            <p>{{ comment.content }}</p>
                        </i>
                        <p class="title">
                        On <a href="{{ url_for('post',
                                                post_id=comment.post.id) }}">
                                {{ comment.post.title }}
                              </a>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                {% endfor %}
            </div>
    </div>
{% endblock %}
Save and close the file.

Here, you extend the base template, set a title, and go through the comments using a for loop. You display the comment’s ID, its content, and a link to the post it belongs to. You access the post data via comment.post.

Use your browser to navigate to the comments page:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/comments/
You’ll see a page similar to the following:

Comments Page

Now edit the base.html template to make the Comments navbar link point to this Comments page:

nano templates/base.html
Edit the navigation bar to look as follows:

flask_app/templates/base.html
    <nav>
        <a href="{{ url_for('index') }}">FlaskApp</a>
        <a href="{{ url_for('comments') }}">Comments</a>
        <a href="#">About</a>
    </nav>
Save and close the file.

Refresh your comments page, and you’ll see that the Comments navbar link works.

You now have a page that displays all the comments in the database. Next, you’ll add a button below each comment on the post page to allow users to delete it.

Step 7 — Deleting Comments
In this step, you’ll add a Delete Comment button below each comment to allow users to delete unwanted comments.

First, you’ll add a new /comments/ID/delete route that accepts POST requests. The view function will receive the ID of the comment you want to delete, fetch it from the database, delete it, and the redirect to post page the deleted comment was on.

Open app.py:

nano app.py
Add the following route to the end of the file.

flask_app/app.py
# ...

@app.post('/comments/<int:comment_id>/delete')
def delete_comment(comment_id):
    comment = Comment.query.get_or_404(comment_id)
    post_id = comment.post.id
    db.session.delete(comment)
    db.session.commit()
    return redirect(url_for('post', post_id=post_id))
Save and close the file.

Here, instead of using the usual app.route decorator, you use the app.post decorator introduced in Flask version 2.0.0, which added shortcuts for common HTTP methods. For example, @app.post("/login") is a shortcut for @app.route("/login", methods=["POST"]). This means that this view function only accepts POST requests, and navigating to the /comments/ID/delete route on your browser will return a 405 Method Not Allowed error, because web browsers default to GET requests. To delete a comment, the user clicks on a button that sends a POST request to this route.

This delete_comment() view function receives the ID of the comment to be deleted via the comment_id URL variable. You use the get_or_404() method to get a comment and save it in a comment variable, or respond with a 404 Not Found in case the comment doesn’t exist. You save the post ID of the post the comment belongs to in a post_id variable, which you’ll use to redirect to the post after deleting the comment.

You use the delete() method on the database session in the line db.session.delete(comment), passing it the comment object. This sets up the session to delete the comment whenever the transaction is committed. Because you don’t need to perform any other modifications, you directly commit the transaction using db.session.commit(). Lastly, you redirect the user to the post the now-deleted comment was posted on.

Next, edit the post.html template to add a Delete Comment button below each comment:

nano templates/post.html
Edit the for loop by adding a new <form> tag directly below the comment content:

flask_app/templates/post.html
    {% for comment in post.comments %}
        <div class="comment">
            <p>#{{ comment.id }}</p>
            <p>{{ comment.content }}</p>
            <form method="POST"
                action="{{ url_for('delete_comment',
                                    comment_id=comment.id) }}">
                <input type="submit" value="Delete Comment"
                    onclick="return confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this entry?')">
            </form>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
Save and close the file.

Here, you have a web form that submits a POST request to the delete_comment() view function. You pass comment.id as an argument for the comment_id parameter to specify the comment that will be deleted. You use the confirm() method function available in web browsers to display a confirmation message before submitting the request.

Now navigate to a post page on your browser:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/2/
You’ll see a Delete Comment button below each comment. Click on it, and confirm the deletion. You’ll see that the comment has been deleted.

You now have a way of deleting comments from the database.

Conclusion
You built a small blogging system that demonstrates how to manage one-to-many relationships using the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension. You learned how to connect a parent table with a child table, associate a child object with its parent and add it to the database, and how to access child data from a parent entry and vise versa.
